      <h1>Pumpkin Bread</h1>
      <p> Pumpkin bread is a type of moist quick bread made with pumpkin.[1] The pumpkin can be cooked and softened before being used or simply baked with the bread; using canned pumpkin renders it a simpler dish to prepare. Additional ingredients include nuts (such as walnuts)[2] and raisins.[3]

Pumpkin bread is usually baked in a rectangular loaf pan and is often made in late fall when fresh pumpkins are available. It can also be made from canned pumpkin, resulting in a stronger pumpkin taste.</p>
