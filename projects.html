    <p>My passion for surf culture and board design has been developed through my work with "Surfing Cowboys"</p>
    <p>I began working with Surfing Cowboys to help them create short biographies about influential shapers in surf history, and to implement research and my interest in board design to fuel the creation of this project for their website, and to honor the pioneers of our lifestyle to preserve the foundations of surf culture.</p>
