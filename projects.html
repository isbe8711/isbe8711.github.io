    <p>My passion for surf culture and board design has been further developed through my work with "Surfing Cowboys".
    Surfing Cowboys is a cultural phenomenon in the Malibu community, serving as one of the best vintage shops in LA selling rare cultural artifacts, collectible surfboards, and some of the best Californian vintage style clothes as well as their own clothing line all handmade in California.</p>
    <p>I began working with Surfing Cowboys to help them create short biographies about influential shapers in surf history who have play an important role in their brand, and to implement research and my interest in board design to fuel the creation of this project for their website, and to honor the pioneers of our lifestyle to preserve the foundations of surf culture.</p>
